/**
 * What the reader sees while a page is being fetched.
 *
 * WHY A TEMPLATE AND NOT A PROGRESS BAR. Next re-mounts a `template.tsx` on
 * every navigation, which is the one hook that fires for every route change
 * without a router listener, a spinner library or a piece of global state. The
 * page arrives rather than appearing, and that arrival IS the feedback: a bar
 * crawling across the top of the screen is a second thing to watch, and it
 * describes a duration nobody measured.
 *
 * THIS IS NVC'S GESTURE, ADAPTED. That site uses the same file with a spring at
 * stiffness 260 and damping 20, and a 20px rise. Two things are changed here.
 * The rise is 12px, because this masthead is 204 pixels tall on a phone and a
 * 20px jump under a fixed header reads as the header moving. And it is an eased
 * curve rather than a spring: everything on this site decelerates into place and
 * nothing overshoots, which is written into the token file as `--ease-draw`, and
 * a page that bounces would be the only thing here that does.
 *
 * 260ms, which is the one number that mattered. Long enough to be seen on a slow
 * connection, short enough that a reader who knows where they are going does not
 * wait for it. Below that the movement is a flicker; above 320 it starts to feel
 * like the site is thinking.
 *
 * IT DOES NOT REPLACE THE SCROLL-REVEAL. `.enter` still stages the bands inside
 * a page as they are scrolled to. This is the page as a whole answering the
 * click; that is its contents answering the scroll. The two run at different
 * moments and neither waits for the other.
 *
 * `useReducedMotion` removes the transform entirely rather than shortening it.
 * A reader who asked for no motion is not asking for less of it.
