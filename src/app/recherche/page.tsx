/**
 * The results page behind the masthead field.
 *
 * WHAT THE PAGE PROMISES. Every list on this site has to be a query a customer
 * could run again, and this one states its own in the lead: every reference
 * whose name, brand or family carries ALL the words typed. That last word is
 * why "onduleur 1500" returns eleven references and not four hundred, and it is
 * also why a misspelling returns nothing, so the empty state below says it
 * plainly instead of shrugging.
 *
 * WHAT "ALL THESE WORDS" ACTUALLY MEANS, AND WHY THE LEAD SAYS IT. The match is
 * on WORD STARTS, not on substrings: "ondul" finds "onduleur" because the word
 * begins that way, and "hp" does NOT find a Hikvision switch because "hp" starts
 * no word in it. The consequence the copy has to own is arithmetic: "hp"
 * returns 597 references while `/marque/hp` counts 544, because the prefix also
 * catches the 43 HPE. Both figures are right — a text search and a brand facet
 * are two different questions — so this page states the rule and NEVER claims to
 * be showing "toutes les références HP". The lead is the place that says it,
 * because the lead is what a reader compares against the count in the corner.
 *
 * THE DEPARTMENT FILTER IS COUNTED, NOT LISTED. A row of twelve departments
 * where nine lead to an empty page is a row of nine traps: they look identical
 * to the three that work. So the search runs once per department and only the
 * departments actually holding something appear, each carrying its own figure.
 * That is twelve extra scans of a 4 254-row array on a page that is rendered on
 * demand, which is real work, and it buys the one thing a filter row has to be:
 * true.
 *
 * WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE DEPARTMENT IS THE PROBLEM. `getSearchPage` returns
 * `totalUnscoped` alongside `total` precisely so this page can tell the
 * difference between "the shop does not have it" and "the shop does not have it
 * HERE". A scoped search that lands on zero while the catalogue holds
 * thirty-four is not an empty page, it is a page with one link on it, and that
 * link widens the search rather than starting it again.
 *
 * WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT EXIST. `?rayon=` is a piece of URL,
 * and URLs are edited, shared, bookmarked and outlived by the taxonomy they name.
 * `getSearchPage` resolves an unknown slug to "no department" and answers for the
 * whole catalogue, which is the right answer and the wrong silence: the reader
 * asked one question and got another one back with no notice, and every count on
 * the page then reads as the count for a department that was never applied. So
 * the slug is resolved HERE first, and a slug that resolves to nothing is stated
 * above the results in the reader's own words before anything else is drawn.
 *
 * IT IS NOT INDEXED. A search page is an infinite URL space over content that
 * already has its own pages: every family, every brand and every product is
 * indexable in its own right, and letting a crawler in here would put thousands
 * of thin permutations of them into the index competing with the originals.

 * 4 254 references live. They are drawn only when nothing more specific fired,
 * because under a list of matching families they would be noise.
 *
 * WHY THE FIRST BLOCK CARRIES NO TOP MARGIN AND NO RULE. Each block used to own
 * its own `mt-stack` and the last one owned a rule as well, which meant that in

/**
 * The twelve doors.
 *
 * ONE COMPONENT, TWO STATES, BECAUSE IT IS ONE ANSWER. "There is nothing for
 * these words" and "you have not typed anything yet" are different sentences
 * with the same next step, and the next step is the department list with its
 * real counts. It used to exist only inside the no-query state, which is the
 * state almost nobody reaches, while the dead-end state that everybody reaches
 * had nothing to offer. Same markup in both, so the two can never drift.
 *
 * The counts are the catalogue's own `totalCount` per department, not a figure
 * about the query: they say how big each room is, which is exactly the question
 * a reader who has run out of words is asking.
 *
 * AND ON A PHONE THE TWELVE ARE A LIST, NOT A GRID, BECAUSE HERE THE COST OF THE
 * GRID IS PAID BY THE ONE CONTROL THAT MATTERS. Measured at 360 before this was
 * touched: each door was 87.9 tall with its two-line gloss, the twelve came to
 * 1 406.5, and the block sits directly above "Le comptoir sait, lui" — so the
 * WhatsApp button, the human a reader falls back on when the catalogue has
 * failed them, was at y 2 369 on a 4 198-pixel page. Three screens below the
 * fold, on the state of this page that more people see than any other.
 *
 * Set as the site's ordinary index row — a rule between, the name left, the
 * count right, 52 tall, no gloss — the twelve measure 624 and the button comes
 * up to y 1 587. The reasoning behind dropping the gloss rather than truncating
 * it is written out over the same list in `/catalogue`.
 *
 * `sm:` puts the grid back untouched: at 1440 the li measures 181 x 129.6 inside
 * the dead end's 62ch column and 381.3 x 87.9 on the full-width empty state.
