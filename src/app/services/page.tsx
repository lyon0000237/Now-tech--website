/**
 * `/services`, the page that sells WORK, and the one page on this site with no
 * way into the basket.
 *
 * THE COMPLAINT THIS REWRITE ANSWERS, in the shop owner's own words: "on ne peut
 * pas avoir le même détaillé des produits aux services, le panier sert à ce
 * moment à quoi, je ne comprends plus". He is right, and the fault was ours.
 * This page used to print nineteen prestations as a price list in which EVERY
 * ROW LINKED TO `/produit/<slug>`, and a product sheet carries an Ajouter au
 * panier button. So the site said, in the same breath, that an installation of
 * fire detectors is quoted after a site survey and that you may put it in a
 * basket for 45 000 FCFA. Then it printed fourteen laptops, printers and a drone
 * underneath. Nobody can hold that shape in their head, and a customer who
 * cannot tell what the basket is for stops using it for the things it IS for.
 *
 * THE FIX IS A CUT, NOT A LAYOUT. Not one link on this page reaches a product
 * sheet. A prestation row opens WhatsApp with the request already written,
 * because a site survey is arranged by a human and always was: the product
 * sheets for these nineteen records still exist and are still reachable from
 * `/rayon/services-occasion` and from search, which is where a record that has a
 * basket button belongs.
 *
 * THE SECOND CUT IS THE FOURTEEN PIECES OF HARDWARE. They are gone from the
 * page as a list and stated as a fact, with the count and the way through to the
 * department. Printed as rows they were the confusion itself; deleted in silence
 * they would look like an omission, and four of them are not even in the Services
 * & Occasion department: they are filed under GPS Tracker, Imprimantes EPSON and
 * Laptop HP, so "go and see them next door" had to become "go and see the
 * department, and search for the rest".
 *
 * NOT ONE PRESTATION, RATE, DELAY OR GUARANTEE IS INVENTED HERE. Every row is a
 * record from the export and every figure is that record's own price. The
 * sentences this page adds are each already asserted elsewhere in this repository
 * and are quoted rather than rewritten, so they cannot drift:
 *   - what the workshop installs, and that a prestation is quoted after a site
 *     survey: `constants/assistant.ts`, the `installation` topic, which is also
 *     what Bod answers on every page of this site;
 *   - that a list of material comes back as a facture proforma: the same file,
 *     the `devis` topic, and `/devis` itself;
 *   - that nothing is paid online: `constants/site.ts`, `PAYMENT_METHODS`, whose
 *     five entries are cash, two mobile-money wallets and a bank transfer;
 *   - where the counters are: the same file, `PICKUP_LINE`, printed verbatim
 *     rather than retyped, exactly as the utility strip and the service band do;
 *   - that WhatsApp is where this shop is reached: the same file, and the
 *     showroom band on the homepage.
 * No lead time appears anywhere below. The record names carry the supplier's own
 * "Express" and "Rapide"; the page never turns those into a promise of its own.
 *
 * TWO CLAIMS WERE CUT FROM THIS PAGE FOR HAVING NO SOURCE AT ALL, and both read
 * as harmless until you look for the file that backs them:
 *   - "les équipes interviennent sur site à Douala et à Yaoundé", in the lead and
 *     in the meta description. Nothing in this repository says where a technician
 *     travels. `SHOWROOMS` says where the three counters ARE and `DELIVERY_CITIES`
 *     says where a parcel goes; neither is a service area, and inventing one on a
 *     page whose whole point is that it does not invent is the worst place to do
 *     it. The counters are stated instead, from `PICKUP_LINE`, which is true.
 *   - "le prix dépend du nombre de points, des distances et de l'état de
 *     l'existant". Plausible, unsourced, and a price list in disguise: it tells a
 *     reader that distance is billed. `assistant.ts` says only that the prestation
 *     is quoted after a site survey, so that is all this page says.
 *
 * The nameless record is dropped. A row with no name is not a service the shop
 * declines to describe, it is a hole in the export.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE SECOND COMPLAINT, AND THE SECOND REWRITE: "visuellement c'est fade", "on
 * a l'impression de ne pas tomber sur l'essentiel".
 *
 * MEASURED AT 390 x 844 BEFORE THIS PASS: 679 words, ZERO images, 5 680 pixels
 * tall. The most text and the least picture of any page on this storefront, and
 * the numbers say why it reads as fade: a reader arrived at a wall of type and
 * had to travel six and a half screens through it to learn that this shop knows
 * how to run cable. The five trades were the answer to his question and they
 * were buried in prose he had no reason to finish.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED, IN THREE MOVES.
 *
 * 1. THE LEAD IS NOW THE SOURCE SENTENCE AND NOTHING ELSE. It ran to 55 words
 *    and its last two sentences restated, in the reader's first screen, exactly
 *    what the green rail one screen later says with a heading and a button:
 *    that a prestation is not put in a basket. Saying it twice did not make it
 *    twice as clear, it made the top of the page an essay. The lead is now the
 *    `installation` answer from `constants/assistant.ts` verbatim, both
 *    sentences of it, which is the one public claim this shop makes about its
 *    own workshop and the same words Bod speaks on every page of this site.
 *    26 words. The panier boundary is not lost: it is the rail's own heading.
 *
 * 2. THE FIVE TRADES COME FIRST, AS PICTURES, AND ON A PHONE THEY SCROLL
 *    SIDEWAYS. A shelf and not a stack, because a stack of five photographs is
 *    five screens of scrolling before the second one and the whole complaint
 *    was about scrolling past the essential. It is a shelf in the strict sense
 *    the house rule sets: it snaps, it lets the next card show past the right
 *    edge so the eye knows there is a sixth thing to reach for, it contains its
 *    own overscroll so a horizontal flick never steals the page's vertical
 *    travel, and it exists ONLY below `md`. From `md` it is a grid, three then
 *    five across, because a desktop reader comparing five trades wants them all
 *    on one line and a mouse has no inertia to flick with. Each tile jumps to
 *    that trade's own list further down, so the five headings are one gesture
 *    away instead of 679 words away.
 *
 * 3. THE PICTURES ARE THE ONLY DOWNLOADED PHOTOGRAPHS ON THIS STOREFRONT, and
 *    `constants/services.ts` carries the whole argument for why this page is
 *    the exception and what the five are forbidden from showing. The short
 *    version: the workshop sells labour, labour has no packshot, and the
 *    fourteen pieces of hardware that share the supplier's term are the exact
 *    confusion this page was written to remove. `PHOTO_NOTE` prints under the
 *    shelf so no reader can take a stock camera wall for the counter in Akwa.
 *
 * WHAT DID NOT CHANGE, AND WAS NOT ALLOWED TO. Not one prestation, rate, delay,
 * guarantee or service area is added by this pass. Not one link on this page
 * reaches `/produit`. The nineteen rows still open WhatsApp with the request
 * already written, the rail still hands over two telephone numbers and the
 * three counters from `PICKUP_LINE`, and the fourteen pieces of hardware are
 * still stated as a fact and not printed as a list.
