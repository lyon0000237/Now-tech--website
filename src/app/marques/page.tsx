/**
 * The brand directory: ONE index, in tiles, paginated, and now photographed.
 *
 * WHAT THIS LIST IS, BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE. The WooCommerce export carries no
 * brand taxonomy: the column exists and is filled on 14 rows out of 7 116. The
 * 101 names below were recovered at ingest by reading category paths and product
 * titles, which is what makes it possible to hold an HP laptop and a Dell one in
 * a single list, something the current site cannot do. The page says so out
 * loud, because a wall of manufacturer names on a retailer's site is normally
 * read as a claim of distribution, and this one is not one. Nothing here is a
 * partnership, an official distribution or a certification. It is an inventory
 * fact: 3 042 of the 4 254 references carry a recovered brand, and each name
 * opens the same query a customer could run themselves.
 *
 * THIS PAGE CARRIED 451 WORDS AND NOT ONE PICTURE, AND THAT IS WHAT CHANGED.
 * Measured on a 390x844 phone before this pass: 451 words, 0 images, 6 000
 * pixels of page. The reader met a title, a lead, three figures, a paragraph, a
 * filter, an ordering bar and only then, at y=1 721, the first thing that could
 * be called merchandise: the word HP. A shop whose brand page shows nothing it
 * sells is a directory, and the client's own words for it were "visuellement
 * c'est fade".
 *
 * THE PICTURES COME FROM THE SHOP, NOT FROM A STOCK LIBRARY. 68 of the 101
 * brands have no logo and never will (see the mark note below), but every one of
 * the 101 has PHOTOGRAPHED PRODUCTS: checked across the whole catalogue, not one
 * brand with references is without at least one packshot, and 100 of the 101
 * have one in every family they appear in. So each brand is illustrated by one
 * of its own references, the most recent one the supplier photographed, resolved
 * through {@link brandPicture}. It is free, it needs no licence, and it is TRUE:
 * a real ZKTECO terminal says more about ZKTECO than a logo we do not hold.
 *
 * ONE BRAND, ONE PHOTOGRAPH, TWO SIZES. The same picture is used big in the
 * shelf at the top and small in the index tile below, so a reader who saw
 * HIKVISION in the shelf recognises it in the index. It is a system rather than
 * two decorations, which is why the shelf may sit above the index without being
 * a second list: it is the first twelve of the same list, enlarged.
 *
 * THE SHELF SCROLLS SIDEWAYS ON A PHONE AND IS A GRID EVERYWHERE ELSE. Twelve
 * square photographs stacked vertically would be 3 000 pixels of page, which is
 * the disease and not the cure, so under 768 the shelf is a rail: it snaps
 * (`snap-x mandatory` on the rail, `snap-start` on the cards), it contains its
 * own overscroll so it never steals the page's vertical scroll, it bleeds into
 * the gutter so the next card is visibly cut by the screen edge, and every card
 * is a 200-pixel touch target. From `md` it is a plain grid, four columns then
 * six, exactly as it always would have been drawn: the rail exists only where
 * the screen cannot hold a grid.
 *
 * ONE TILE IN THREE CARRIES A MARK, AND THAT WAS THE OLD DESIGN PROBLEM.
 * Marks exist for 33 of the 101 and never will for the other 68: the names were
 * checked one by one against Simple Icons' index, 3 453 entries, and 67 are not
 * in it. Simple Icons dropped most non-free marks in 2024, so Canon, Logitech,
 * Microsoft, Philips, Xerox, Brother, SanDisk, Western Digital, Hisense, TCL,
 * BenQ, Transcend, Ricoh, Legrand, Eaton, Tenda, D-Link, APC, HPE and HIKVISION
 * are absent, and HIKVISION is 266 references, the second deepest brand in the
 * shop. Nothing may be drawn in their place: an initial in a circle or a grey
 * rectangle is a fabricated logo standing exactly where a real one is missing.
 *
 * THE PHOTOGRAPH DOES NOT REPLACE THE MARK, IT ANSWERS A DIFFERENT QUESTION.
 * The mark is still a stamp in the tile's bottom corner, absent on 68 tiles, and
 * the page still prints that ratio in figures. What the photograph does is stop
 * the coverage rate from being the page's subject: a tile now shows a product
 * whether or not we hold the logo, so an empty corner is a missing file on a
 * tile that is already complete rather than a hole in the middle of it.
 *
 * WHY THE STAMP IS 40 PIXELS AND NOT 48. Every file in the set is a 24x24
 * square, so `contain` binds the mark to the box and a wordmark like PANASONIC,
 * 6.25 wide for 1 tall inside its file, is drawn across 40 by 6.4 of it. The old
 * wall answered with 48, which multiplied whatever the file already painted, and
 * the heaviest files paint a great deal: the ink measurement that decides which
 * ones are cut back to 30 is written out over the constant below. At 48 they
 * came out as black slabs beside every wordmark, which is the audit finding this
 * page was rebuilt to answer.
 *
 * TWO READERS, ONE INDEX. Someone asking "vous avez du Mikrotik ?" needs to hit
 * one name out of 101; someone asking what this shop actually stocks needs to
 * see that HP has 544 references and eight brands have exactly one. Those wants
 * are opposite orderings of the same list, so the list is ordered two ways and
 * the reader picks. Both orderings are URLs, not state: `?tri=nom` is shareable,
 * back-buttonable and renders without JavaScript, the filter is a plain GET form
 * for the same reason, and so is the page number. No client component beyond the
 * packshots themselves, no 3.3 MB catalogue anywhere near the browser.
 *
 * AND BECAUSE THEY ARE URLS, EVERY CONTROL COSTS A COLD LOAD, WHICH IS WHY THIS
 * PAGE HAS TWO STATES. The filter form and the pager do not refresh a grid in
 * place; they fetch the document again, and the reader lands wherever that new
 * document starts. Measured at 390 on the live page: the first tile of
 * `?q=hik` sat at 1 757 pixels, two full screens under an 844-pixel viewport,
 * behind a title, a lead, three figures and a paragraph the reader had just
 * scrolled past. The `#index` fragment does not rescue it. Measured in a cold
 * browser, one launched per URL: `/marques#index` lands at scrollY 0 and so
 * does `/marques?q=i#index`, while the same address lands at 822 under
 * `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` and an in-page click on an ordering link
 * lands at 831. The fragment therefore serves the reader who is already on the
 * page and is dropped on the load that follows the form, which is the one load
 * that needed it. It is kept, because it costs nothing and it is right for
 * those two cases, but it is not what solves this.
 *
 * WHAT SOLVES IT IS THAT AN ANSWERING PAGE STOPS INTRODUCING ITSELF. The three
 * figures, the long paragraph AND THE SHELF are the front door: they say what
 * kind of list this is to someone who arrived at `/marques` and has asked for
 * nothing yet. A reader who typed "hik", or who is on page 2, has asked, and
 * replying with 620 pixels of preamble is answering a question with the
 * question. So `?q=` and `?page=` drop the band, drop the shelf and shorten the
 * lead, and they lose no pictures by it: every tile in the index carries one.
 * `?tri=` is not one of these states and keeps the whole front door, because it
 * is the same 101 names in another order.

 * The mark files that outweigh the set, and the measured rule that picks them.
 *
 * MEASURED, NOT JUDGED, AND RE-RUNNABLE. Every file in `public/brands` is a
 * 24x24 square painted with `mask-size: contain` inside a box of one size, so
 * the only thing deciding how much ink lands in a tile is the share of that
 * 24x24 box the artwork paints. Each of the 33 was rasterised at 200x200 in the
 * browser and every pixel over alpha 24 counted: the set runs from KASPERSKY at
 * 6.8 % to XIAOMI at 74.5 %, median INTEL 17.8 %.
 *
 * THE RULE IS TWO AND A HALF TIMES THE MEDIAN, 44.5 %, and it takes seven:
 * XIAOMI 74.5, MIKROTIK 56.8, HP 54.6, APPLE 52.3, LINKSYS 51.5, UBIQUITI 48.6,
 * TP-LINK 46.0. HUAWEI at 42.9 and FORTINET at 41.0 sit just under it and stay
 * where they are. A hand-picked four is what this replaces, and it was picked
 * wrong: it cut UBIQUITI while leaving APPLE and LINKSYS, both of which paint
 * more ink than UBIQUITI does.
 *
 * WHY 30 PIXELS AND NOT 40. Area falls with the square, so a 30-pixel box is
 * 900 square pixels against 1 600 and the ink drops to 56 % of what it was.
 * XIAOMI goes from 1 192 painted pixels to 671, and the heaviest mark left in
 * the grid becomes HUAWEI at 686, which is 2.4 times the median's 285 where it
 * used to be XIAOMI at 4.2 times. Nothing is ever enlarged: a mark can only be
 * too loud on this page, never too quiet, because the name set above it is what
 * identifies the brand and the mark is an ornament on a tile that already reads.
 *
 * LENOVO IS NOT IN THE LIST AND IT IS THE ONE THAT LOOKS LIKE IT SHOULD BE. Its
 * file is a filled bar with the word reversed out of it, so it reads darker than
 * anything near it, but it paints 28.8 % of the box, 460 square pixels, 1.6
 * times the median and well inside the range the rest of the set lives in.
 * Shrinking it would not make it less of a bar, only a smaller one. The rule is
 * ink, because ink is the thing that unbalances a grid.

/**
 * The stamp box, in rem: 40 pixels, or 30 for a file that paints too much.
 *
 * It is published to the tile as `--stamp-base` rather than used directly,
 * because under 360 pixels the tile cannot afford it and the class on the tile
 * takes four fifths: 32, or 24 for a dense file.
 *
 * WHY FOUR FIFTHS AND WHY 360, AND IT IS THE DEPARTMENT LINE THAT DECIDED IT,
 * NOT THE COUNT. The count is handled a few lines below by switching its unit,
 * because at 320 no stamp size can save it: "544 références" needs 107.8 pixels
 * on one line and the whole tile is 124. The department under it is the line
 * this size protects. Measured at 320 across all three pages, the widest label
 * in the set is "Ordinateurs" at 70.3 pixels; a 40-pixel stamp and its 12-pixel
 * gap leave the column 72, which is 1.7 pixels of clearance and therefore an
 * ellipsis as soon as a fallback face is drawn instead of the measured one. 32
 * leaves 80, which is 9.7. It is also a matter of proportion: 40 pixels of mark
 * in a 124-pixel tile is a third of the tile's width given to the ornament, and
 * the name is what identifies the brand. At 360 the tile is 141, the column is
 * 89, and the full 40 costs nothing, which is where the break point goes.
 *
 * THE VARIANT IS WRITTEN `max-[360px]` AND IT MEANS UNDER 360, NOT UP TO IT.
 * Tailwind v4 compiles it to `@media not (min-width: 360px)`, so 360 itself
 * keeps the full stamp and 359 does not. Written `max-[359px]` it was checked
 * on a 359-pixel viewport and the stamp came back 40: the query excludes its
 * own bound, and one pixel of the range that needed the fix was outside it.

 * a brand's products the way the whole site orders products: photographed ones

 * ranked or promoted: there is no "best-seller" field in this export and there
 * will not be one invented here.
 *
 * IT IS MEMOISED BECAUSE THE CATALOGUE IS A FILE, NOT A DATABASE. The dataset is
 * a static JSON import that cannot change while the process lives, so a brand's
 * photograph cannot change either. Without the cache a front-door render pays
 * 36 tiles plus 12 shelf cards of listing work; with it, each brand is resolved

              margins are cancelled, the snapping is switched off and the card

            IT IS BUILT TO WORK WITH SCRIPTING OFF AND THE SITE CURRENTLY DOES
            NOT, WHICH IS NOT THIS FORM'S DOING. Measured with script execution
            disabled at 1440: this page renders its masthead and its footer with
            nothing between them, and so does `/`, so the body of every route is
            hidden. The markup is all there, 36 tiles in the DOM and the field
            among them, painted at opacity 0. The stylesheet is not the culprit:
            its entrance states are gated on `(scripting: enabled)` exactly as
            they claim to be. The server HTML is. `src/app/template.tsx` wraps
            every route in a `motion.div` and ships its initial state as an
            inline `style="opacity:0;transform:translateY(12px)"`, which is in
            the response for every page and needs JavaScript to be animated
            away. Nothing in this file can reach it. It is recorded here because
            this form's whole justification is that it does not need scripting,
            and the next reader has to know the promise is broken one layer up.

            THE FIELD IS 56 TALL AND SET AT 16 PIXELS ON A PHONE, 48 AND 13 FROM
            MD UP. Two measured reasons, one each. Set at 13, iOS Safari zooms
            the page the instant the field takes focus and leaves it zoomed,
            which on a 101-name index is a page the reader then has to pan
            sideways to read; 16 is the threshold that stops it. And at `h-13`
            the submit button inside, the field is `items-stretch` with `m-1`
            around it, came out 42 tall, four pixels under the floor, on the one
            control that makes the form do anything. 56 puts it at 46. */}
