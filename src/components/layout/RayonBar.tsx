/**
 * The department bar.
 *
 * The one saturated band on the page, and it is spent on navigation rather than
 * on a promotion. Everything above it is the shop identifying itself and
 * everything below it is merchandise, so the band reads as the line between
 * the two, which is why it carries the catalog trigger at its head.
 *
 * ON A PHONE IT IS THE TRIGGER AND NOTHING ELSE. It carried a second row under
 * this one, a flickable strip of the twelve departments, and that row cost 44
 * pixels of a sticky header already 204 tall on an 844px screen: a quarter of
 * the phone spent on chrome. The strip also showed one and a half departments
 * out of twelve, which is not navigation, it is a hint that navigation exists.
 * The trigger beside it opens all twelve with their families, so the row was
 * paying rent to say something the button already says better.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A CLIENT COMPONENT, AND IT IS THE ONLY REASON. A bar of sections
 * that never says which section you are in is a list of links, not navigation.
 * Marking the current one needs the current path, and the current path is only
 * knowable at render time in the client, so the bar takes `usePathname`. It
 * costs nothing worth counting: this file ships four hrefs, four labels and a
 * prefix test, and the panel beside it was already a client component.

/**
 * The four sections, and WHAT EACH ONE OWNS.
 *
 * `owns` is the second half of the answer. A tab that lights on `/marques` and
 * goes out on `/marque/hp` is worse than no tab at all: the reader took one
 * step down inside the same section and the bar told them they had left it. So
 * every section declares the route roots that belong to it, and the match is on
 * whole segments — `pathname === root || pathname.startsWith(root + '/')` —
 * because `/marques` starts with the string `/marque` and a naive prefix test
 * would light both tabs at once.
 *
 * The roots are disjoint by construction, so at most one tab is ever current.
 *
 * TWO ENTRIES LEFT THIS BAR AND FOR THE SAME REASON. "Nouveautés" was
 * `/catalogue?tri=recent`, the catalogue with one of its four orderings
 * applied. "Occasion" was `/rayon/services-occasion`, which is one of the
 * twelve departments, already reachable from "Tous les rayons" beside it and
 * from the catalogue below it. A bar that lists a page, then lists a sort of
 * that page, then lists one of its departments, tells a reader they are three
 * places. Both were the catalogue wearing a different name.
 *
 * "Installation" became "Services" and kept `/services`, because the page is
 * the whole of what the workshop does and not only the installing part.

/**
 * THE CURRENT TAB AND THE HOVERED TAB MUST NOT DRAW THE SAME MARK.
 *
 * They used to, and that was the whole complaint. `.rail-link` in globals.css
 * draws one 2px line for `:hover`, for `:focus-visible` and for
 * `[aria-current]` alike, so pointing at "Marques" while standing on
 * "Catalogue" produced two identical underlines and no way to tell which one
 * meant "here". Nothing set `aria-current` either, so in practice the bar drew
 * exactly one line: the one under the pointer.
 *
 * The two states are now told apart on three axes at once, which is what makes
 * the answer survive a glance:
 *
 *   CURRENT   a plate, a semibold white label, and a 3px --rail-accent bar that
 *             is simply there. It does not animate, because it is not
 *             answering a gesture.
 *   HOVER     no plate, the label lifts from --rail-ink-2 to white, and a 3px
 *             WHITE bar is drawn in from the leading edge, the same motion
 *             every other link on this site answers with.
 *
 * MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED. On the band, #007a12: the white bar is 5.54:1 and the
 * --rail-accent bar is 4.41:1, both clear of the 3:1 that WCAG 1.4.11 asks of a
 * state indicator. The plate is `black/15`, taking the current tab's ground to
 * #00680f, where white is 7.02:1 and the accent bar over it is 5.59:1. The old
 * --rail-accent was #74e785 at 2.91:1, which is why the hover was reported as
 * invisible: it was under the threshold, and it was the only mark drawn.
 *
 * The bar is 3px rather than 2. Two pixels of a light green, seen for a moment
 * at the bottom edge of a 48px band, is a rendering detail; three is a mark.
