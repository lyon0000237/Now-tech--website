/**
 * The catalog map.
 *
 * Twelve department names in a row is a list, not a map: it says nothing about
 * the families underneath them, which is the level a buyer actually shops at. One trigger replaces the row, and opening it shows the whole structure at
 * once, every department with its deepest families and a count on each.
 *
 * The trigger is the block at the head of the department bar rather than a
 * button floating in the masthead. That position is doing real work: it is the
 * first thing on the one saturated band of the page, it is the same width and
 * weight on every route, and on a phone it is the only navigation that reaches
 * the whole catalog.
 *
 * The panel is rendered inside the sticky header, so `top-full` puts it under
 * the entire masthead rather than under the trigger, which is what lets it run
 * the full width of the page.
 *
 * ON A PHONE IT IS NOT THE SAME PANEL, AND THE MEASUREMENT IS WHY. The grid is
 * three columns at `lg`, two at `md` and one below that, so at 360 the twelve
 * departments and their sixty families stacked into 2 900 pixels of content
 * inside a 474 pixel window. Twelve screens of scrolling, inside a dropdown,
 * over rows 20 pixels tall set 11 pixels apart: every target under half of the
 * 44 the finger needs, and the way out at the foot, "Voir l'index complet",
 * 2 900 pixels down where nobody was ever going to meet it.
 *
 * So below `md` the same data is drawn as an accordion: twelve rows of 56
 * pixels, one open at a time, each opening onto its own families at 44 pixels a
 * row with the whole department as the first entry. Twelve rows is 672 pixels,
 * which is a flick and a half rather than twelve screens, and the index link is
 * pinned to the foot of the panel where it is on screen at every scroll
 * position. The desktop subtree is untouched and still renders its grid; the
 * two are siblings under one `md:` switch rather than one layout bent to cover
 * both, because a grid of sixty destinations and a list of twelve are not the
 * same object.
 *
 * The panel's own height is `100dvh` minus the masthead rather than `74vh`,
 * again below `md` only: at 360 x 640 the old cap put the panel's bottom edge
 * at 642, two pixels past the screen, and `vh` is the unit that ignores the
 * address bar.
