/**
 * The masthead, in three rows.
 *
 * Counter strip, then the shop and its search, then the departments. That order
 * is the order the three questions arrive in: who are you, what do you have,
 * where do I start.
 *
 * WHAT PINS AND WHY. Three rows is 144 pixels, and pinning all of them would
 * spend a fifth of a phone screen on chrome. The header is therefore sticky at a
 * negative offset equal to its own first row, so that row scrolls out of the way
 * and the rest stays. The row that leaves is different per breakpoint because
 * the row worth keeping is: a desktop reader loses the phone numbers and keeps
 * search and the departments, a phone reader loses the wordmark and keeps search
 * and the departments. Search survives both, which is the point. No JavaScript
 * is involved: the offset is a `top` value and the browser does the rest.
 *
 * The phone layout is not the desktop one shrunk. On a 390px screen a search
 * field sharing a row with a wordmark and a basket is left about 110 pixels,
 * which is a field nobody can read what they typed into, so search takes a row
 * of its own.
 *
 * WHAT THE PHONE ROW COSTS, MEASURED. 56 + 64 + 48 = 168 pixels at rest and 112
 * once the wordmark row has lifted, on a 640-tall Android: 26 per cent of the
 * screen before the first word, 17.5 per cent for the rest of the session. The
 * budget is spent on the three questions and nothing else, so the arithmetic is
 * kept and the pixels inside it are rearranged: the search field grew from 52 to
 * 56 so its submit clears 44 (see SearchField), and the row's own bottom padding
 * gave the four pixels back. The row is 64 before and 64 after.
 *
 * TWO CONTROLS IN THE CORNER, EIGHT PIXELS APART, NOT FOUR. `gap-1` put the
 * account trigger and the basket 4px apart, which is inside the width of a
 * thumb: measured at 360 the two 44px targets sat at x=240 and x=288 with four
 * pixels of paper between them, and the miss lands on the other one. `gap-2` is
 * the same value the row already used from `md` up, so the desktop measures the
 * same 166 and 97 pixel boxes it did before.
