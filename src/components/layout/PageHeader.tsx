/**
 * The head of an inner page.
 *
 * One shape for every page that is not the homepage, so the transition between
 * a department, a family and an editorial page never feels like a jump to a
 * different site. Left-aligned rather than centred: the homepage opening is a
 * single declarative moment and earns the centre axis, while these pages are
 * the start of a read and want an edge to run down.
 *
 * THE PHONE GETS ITS OWN TOP AND BOTTOM, AND ONLY BECAUSE OF WHAT SITS ABOVE
 * IT. The clamp bottoms out at 48 and 40 pixels, which are desktop numbers that
 * never shrink: under a masthead already 168 pixels tall on a 640 screen, the
 * title of an inner page started at y=216 and the rest of the page below that,
 * so a third of the screen was spent before the page said anything. 32 and 24
 * below `sm` give 32 of those pixels back. The clamp is untouched from `sm` up,
 * where it was already returning its own minimum, so nothing from 640 to 1920
 * moves by a pixel.
 *
 * AND THE PHONE NUMBERS CAME DOWN AGAIN, TO 24 AND 20, BECAUSE THIS HEADER IS
 * NOT THE PAGE. Measured at 390 on /categorie/ordinateurs-portables-laptop,
 * this block ran 188 to 394 — 206 pixels — for a title, a count and two lines
 * of lead, and the first product photograph on that page was at y=900. On a 844
 * screen with 116 pixels of masthead, every pixel this block spends is a pixel
 * the reader pays before seeing anything the shop sells. The four that were cut
 * are all air and none of them is a word: 32 to 24 above, 24 to 20 below, the
 * gap between the title and the count 12 to 6, the gap above the lead 16 to 12.
 * 206 becomes 184.
 *
 * THE COUNT WAS NOT MOVED AND NOT HIDDEN, THOUGH IT IS THE OBVIOUS 31 PIXELS.
 * Below `sm` the title takes the whole measure and the aside wraps under it,
 * and on a listing page the same figure is printed again by the sort bar a few
 * hundred pixels down. It stays because this header also serves /a-propos,
 * /contact, /devis and /recherche, and on the empty-result state of the last
 * one the aside is the only place the figure appears at all. A component that
 * drops information on a phone because four of its six callers happen to repeat
 * it elsewhere is a trap laid for the fifth.
 *
 * THE LEAD KEEPS ITS 17 PIXELS ON A PHONE. It is the one line of type on the
 * page that argues rather than labels, and on /devis and /a-propos it IS the
 * page; setting it at body size below `sm` would have bought about 7 pixels on
 * a listing and cost those two their voice.

   * Promotes the lead from a caption into a statement.
   *
   * WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN A ONE-OFF IN THE PAGE. On most pages the lead is
   * a caption: the title carries the meaning and the sentence under it adds
   * detail, so it is set small and grey and nobody needs to read it. On one page
   * that is backwards. The quote is where a customer decides whether a shop that
   * takes no money online can be trusted, and the answer to that is in the
   * sentence, not in the words "Votre devis". Asked to put the description
   * forward, the honest move is to change its rank, not to add a block beneath
   * it.
   *
   * It is a rank rather than a size: larger type, ink instead of grey, and a
   * hairline in the accent down its leading edge, which is the one place on this
   * site where a rule means "read this" rather than "this is a boundary".
