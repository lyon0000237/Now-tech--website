/**
 * The search field.
 *
 * Search is a primary navigation mode here, not a convenience: 4 254 products
 * across 268 categories is more than any menu can expose, and a buyer who
 * already knows they want a "switch 24 ports PoE" should never have to walk the
 * tree. That is why it sits in the masthead at full width rather than behind an
 * icon.
 *
 * The department selector in front of the field is not decoration either. Half
 * the vocabulary in this catalog is ambiguous across departments: "onduleur"
 * returns power and networking, "caméra" returns surveillance and photography,
 * "switch" returns commutation and light switches. Naming the department costs
 * one click and removes a whole class of dead result page.
 *
 * The placeholder is written in the vocabulary of the catalog, so it doubles as
 * an example of what the field understands.
 *
 * The field is filled with --space, not --surface. --surface is pinned to white
 * in both themes because every packshot is shot on white; a form painted with it
 * kept a white background in the dark theme while its text followed the theme,
 * and the text a customer had just typed measured 1.2:1 against it.
 *
 * WHAT THE PANEL UNDERNEATH IS FOR, AND WHY IT HOLDS THREE KINDS OF THING.
 * A half-typed question has three plausible answers in this shop and only one
 * of them is a product. "caméra" is 440 references and no single one of them is
 * the answer: the family is. "hp" is 544 references across six departments: the
 * brand is. "onduleur 1500 va" is a reference, and that one is a product. So the
 * panel offers families, brands and products, in that order, each group named,
 * because a list that mixes a destination with a reference and draws them the
 * same way makes the reader click one to find out which they got.
 *
 * WHY THE REQUEST IS DEBOUNCED AND CANCELLED. Without the debounce the field
 * asks the server once per keystroke, which on "onduleur" is eight round trips
 * for one question. Without the cancel, the answer to "ond" can land after the
 * answer to "onduleur" on a slow connection and overwrite it, and the reader
 * watches the list go backwards while they type. The abort covers the common
 * case and the query echo in the reply covers the race the abort loses.
 *
 * WHY `useId` AND NOT A CONSTANT ID. The masthead renders this component twice:
 * once inside the wordmark row for pointers, once on its own row below for
 * phones (see Header.tsx). Two elements carrying the same id would be a broken
 * document, and worse, `aria-activedescendant` resolves by id from the whole
 * document: the desktop field would have pointed a screen reader at the hidden
 * mobile field's rows.
 *
 * WHY THE DEPARTMENT TRAVELS WITH THE QUESTION. The selector in front of the
 * field changes what the last row of the panel promises, so it has to change
 * what the rows above it show, or the panel is offering references that are not
 * on the page it is pointing at. The department therefore rides in the request
 * and comes back in the reply, and a reply whose department is not the one now
 * on screen is dropped exactly like a reply whose query is stale. Changing the
 * department is a new question, not a filter over an old answer.
 *
 * WHY THE WAY OUT IS PINNED TO THE FOOT. "Voir tous les résultats" is the row
 * that has to be reachable when none of the others is the answer, and it was
 * the last child of a list that scrolls: on a phone, with the keyboard up and
 * five references drawn at 44 pixels each, it sat below the fold of the panel
 * every single time. A row that is always present and never visible is not
 * present. The panel is now two regions — a list that scrolls and a foot that
 * does not — so the ways out are on screen whatever the list is doing. The
 * listbox spans both, which is why the role sits on their shared parent rather
 * than on a `ul`: the keyboard still walks one list, because there is one list.
