/**
 * The index: every family the shop has, under the department it belongs to.
 *
 * IT IS SET LIKE AN INDEX BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT IT IS. Not tiles, not cards, not
 * twelve photographs of departments. 218 entries drawn as cards is fourteen
 * screens of scrolling to answer "do they carry onduleurs"; the same 218 set as
 * a multi-column list is two screens, and the eye reads a column of names far
 * faster than a field of boxes. This is the one surface on the site where the
 * whole shape of the business is visible at once, and density is the feature.
 *
 * AND DENSITY IS EXACTLY WHAT A PHONE CANNOT BUY. Measured at 390 before this
 * file was touched: the index alone was 11 743 pixels of the catalogue's 18 607,
 * which is fourteen screens of link, and it was the second half of a page a
 * reader had already spent eight screens getting down. Two columns are one
 * column there, so the whole economy that makes this shape work at 1440 —
 * 218 names read three abreast in two screens — is gone, and what is left is a
 * scroll with no landmarks in it.
 *
 * SO ON A PHONE THE INDEX IS FOLDED BY RAYON, AND THE FOLD IS A FRAGMENT LINK.
 * Twelve headings, each with the count of the families under it, and a link that
 * opens exactly one of them. The list is hidden with `display: none` and shown
 * again by `:target`, which is CSS every browser has had since 2001, needs no
 * JavaScript at all, and gives the state a URL: `/catalogue#familles-security`
 * opens the security families for whoever the address is sent to. Only one
 * element in a document can be `:target`, so opening a rayon closes the last
 * one, which is the behaviour an accordion has to be written to get.
 *
 * NOTHING OF THE FOLD REACHES A POINTER. Every rule of it is behind `sm:`, and
 * the index measured unchanged at 1440: three columns, 33.5-pixel rows, all 218
 * names on screen at once. The `:target` rule survives up there and is simply
 * never the thing that decides, because `sm:block` already showed the list.
 *
 * THE COUNT IS THE SECOND COLUMN, IN MONO. It is what makes the index worth
 * reading rather than just navigable: 845 against 3 is the difference between a
 * department and a shelf, and tabular figures are what let a reader compare them
 * down the column instead of item by item.
 *
 * Ordered by count, not alphabetically. A reader scanning for what this shop is
 * actually deep in gets the answer in the first three lines of each block; a
 * reader hunting one name uses the browser's own find, which does not care what
 * order the list is in.
 *
 * CSS columns rather than a grid, because the blocks are lists of wildly
 * different lengths and a grid would leave one column of a twelve-entry
 * department stranded beside three empty ones. `break-inside: avoid` on the row
 * is what stops a name from being cut across the column boundary.
 *
 * THREE COLUMNS AT THE TOP END, NOT FOUR. Four gave each name 276 pixels, and
 * this taxonomy is full of names like "Lecteurs/pointeuses biométriques" that
 * truncate at that width: three of them appeared in the same block, ellipsed at
 * the same character, telling the reader nothing about which was which. Three
 * columns give 388, which carries all but a handful whole.
 *
 * THE OUTER BOX IS A FLEX COLUMN AND NOT A GRID. A grid's implicit `1fr` track
 * is `minmax(auto, 1fr)`, whose floor is the item's min-content width; with a
 * multi-column list inside, that floor exceeded the shell and the track grew
 * past it, so the fourth column and every count in it were painted outside the
 * page and clipped. A flex column stretches its items to the container instead
 * of being sized by them, which is the behaviour this needs.
 *
 * AND THE LEADER LINE IS DELETED ON A PHONE, BECAUSE THERE IT WAS EATING THE
 * NAMES IT WAS DRAWN TO SERVE. Measured at 360: the column is 306 pixels, the
 * rule takes `flex-1` exactly as the name does, so the two split what the count
 * leaves and the name was handed 130 pixels. 62 of the 218 families truncated
 * at that width — "Système d'Exploitat…", "Claviers Externes O…", "Accessoires
 * serveu…" — which is a directory that has stopped naming its own entries. The
 * rule is a device for carrying the eye ACROSS a gap; at one column there is no
 * gap to cross, only a name that no longer fits. `hidden sm:block` gives the
 * name the whole row back, 269 pixels, and truncation falls from 62 to 4.
 *
 * 44 PIXELS TALL ON A PHONE, 33.5 FROM `sm` UP. 218 entries at desktop density
 * is what makes the index readable under a pointer and a column of misses under
 * a thumb; the taller row costs 2 300 pixels down a page nobody reads in one
 * pass, and buys every one of the 218 an honest target.
