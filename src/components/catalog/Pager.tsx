/**
 * Pages, not an infinite scroll.
 *
 * The whole catalogue is 178 pages of 24. Infinite scroll on a list that long
 * destroys the one thing a buyer needs on it: the ability to leave, come back
 * and be in the same place. It also puts the footer, where this shop keeps its
 * counter addresses and its telephone numbers, permanently out of reach.
 *
 * THE WINDOW. Two neighbours either side of the current page, plus the first and
 * the last, plus a gap where the run is broken. That is seven numbers at most,
 * which fits one line on a phone at the size the rest of the page is set in.
 * The first and the last are always there because they are the two a reader
 * actually jumps to; page 89 of 178 is a number nobody wants.
 *
 * Previous and next are icons at the ends rather than words, because the numbers
 * between them already say what they do, and "Précédent"/"Suivant" set beside
 * seven digits makes the row read as a sentence.
 *
 * THAT SENTENCE ONLY HOLDS WHERE THE ROW IS ONE ROW, AND ON A PHONE IT NEVER IS.
 * Measured at 360: the shell gives the nav 306 pixels, seven 44-pixel squares
 * and six 8-pixel gaps need 356, so the row wrapped — and what wrapped was the
 * pair of arrows. On page 40 of 178 the sequence came out as
 * "‹ 1 … 38 39 40" on the first line and "41 42 … 178 ›" on the second, which
 * puts the two controls a reader actually uses, previous and next, in opposite
 * diagonal corners, drawn as two more 44-pixel squares indistinguishable from
 * the nine digits between them. Eleven identical boxes, and the two that matter
 * are the hardest to find.
 *
 * SO UNDER `sm` THE ROW IS DELIBERATELY TWO ROWS, AND THE SECOND ONE IS THE
 * ARROWS. `order` moves the numbers first and the two arrows last, `basis`
 * makes each arrow half the width minus the gap — 149 pixels at 360 — and each
 * one takes the word it was denied at the top of this file, because a 149-pixel
 * box holding a 17-pixel chevron reads as an empty button. The jump targets
 * stay above, where a thumb reaching from the bottom of the screen passes the
 * two common gestures before it reaches the nine rare ones.
 *
 * FROM `sm` UP NONE OF THAT EXISTS: `sm:order-none`, `sm:basis-auto`,
 * `sm:w-11` and `sm:hidden` on the words put the row back to the 44-pixel
 * squares it has always been, measured unchanged at 1440 — nav 356 x 44 on
 * seven items, 564 x 44 on eleven, one line in both cases.
