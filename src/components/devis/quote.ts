/**
 * The arithmetic and the wording of a quote, kept out of the view.
 *
 * THIS FILE IS THE ONLY PLACE THE QUOTE'S NUMBERS AND ITS MESSAGE ARE PRODUCED,
 * because both are claims made to a customer about money and both have to be
 * reproducible by hand. A total assembled inline in JSX is a total nobody can
 * check.
 *
 * WHAT A QUOTE IS ON THIS SITE. There is no payment gateway and there will not
 * be one: the shop is settled in cash at the counter, on delivery, or by Mobile
 * Money against a proforma. So the end of the journey is not a checkout, it is a
 * list of material that leaves for the counter and comes back priced. Nothing
 * below sends anything. It writes a message and hands the customer a link; the
 * customer presses send inside WhatsApp, on their own account.

 * unreliable past roughly two thousand characters of raw text. Past that the
 * message does not arrive shortened with a warning, it arrives cut mid-word, and
 * a basket whose last four references silently vanished is worse than a basket
 * that says out loud which references it is not carrying.
 *
 * So the detail block is budgeted at 900 characters and 15 rows, whichever bites
 * first. With the greeting, the totals and the identity block the whole message
 * lands under 1 300 characters, which encodes to roughly 2 200 of URL: inside
 * every limit in the chain with room to spare.
 *
 * WHAT OVERFLOWS IS THE DETAIL, NEVER THE TOTAL. The totals line is always
 * computed from the entire basket, and the count of rows left out is stated in
