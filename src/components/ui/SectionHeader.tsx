/**
 * The head of a page section: a title, an optional line of context, and an
 * optional escape to the full listing.
 *
 * The rule under it is structural, not decorative. With the merchandise below
 * carrying no borders of its own, the hairline is the only thing in the section
 * that states a column width, and every grid beneath it aligns to that
 * statement. Remove it and the section loses its left and right edges: the
 * heading floats, the grid floats, and nothing tells the eye they are the same
 * object. It is also the finest mark on the page, which is the register the
 * whole layout is set in.
 *
 * The escape link is not decoration. Baymard measured 31% of users struggling
 * to reach a product list on sites whose category pages are pure signposts, so
 * every section that shows a subset owes the customer a way past it.
 *
 * The title and the context are siblings rather than nested: a paragraph inside
 * a heading is invalid, and assistive technology reads the whole block as one
 * long heading.
