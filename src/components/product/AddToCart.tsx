/**
 * Add to basket, from inside a product card.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A QUIET CONTROL AND NOT A BUTTON. Ten of these in a grid, each one a
 * filled accent rectangle, and the grid stops being a page of products and
 * becomes a page of buttons. It is a word with the house rule under it, it
 * appears when the card is pointed at, and on a touch screen, where there is no
 * pointer to appear for, it is simply always there.
 *
 * WHY IT CONFIRMS ON ITSELF. The drawer opens on the other side of the screen,
 * which on a wide monitor is 1 400 pixels from the reader's attention. The
 * control says "Ajouté" where the click happened, and says it politely to a
 * screen reader too, which otherwise gets nothing at all from a panel appearing
 * elsewhere in the document.
 *
 * ON A PHONE IT IS A BOX, AND THAT IS NOT A CHANGE OF MIND. The argument above
 * is about a page of ten cards on a monitor. On a 360px screen the card is 141
 * wide and this control measured 44.44 by 22.19: it cleared 44px in one
 * direction only, and it cleared it in the other by borrowing 12px on every
 * side from a pseudo-element. That expander reaches into the 24px gutter that
 * separates two cards, so the hit areas of the left card's control and the
 * right card's link meet inside it, and a thumb aimed at a photograph puts
 * something in the basket. Below `sm` the control is therefore its own box,
 * 141 by 44, ending exactly where the card ends, with a hairline rather than a
 * fill so a grid of them is still a grid of products. The expander comes back
 * at `sm`, where the cell is 260px and it has somewhere to go.
 *
 * THE OPACITY RULE IS UNTOUCHED, ON PURPOSE. `sm:opacity-0` would sort AFTER
 * `group-hover:opacity-100` in the generated sheet and would kill the hover
 * reveal on every desktop. `[@media(hover:none)]` is what already pins this
 * control visible on a touch screen, and it is measured at 1 there and 0 at
 * 1440.
