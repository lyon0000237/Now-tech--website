/**
 * The product well.
 *
 * This component is the whole image strategy in one place, so no grid ever has
 * to reason about it again.
 *
 * The library is 4,215 supplier packshots of wildly uneven crop, resolution and
 * subject scale, and every one of them was shot on white. So the well is white
 * too: the photograph's own background becomes the well, and there is nothing
 * for a seam to appear between. What varies in the source then reads as
 * variation in the product rather than as sloppiness in the page.
 *
 * The well carries the only border in a product grid. Not the card: a hairline
 * round the whole cell boxes the name, the specs and the price along with the
 * photograph, and those three are type, which the page separates with space
 * everywhere else. The picture is the one thing that needs an edge, because a
 * packshot shot on white sitting on a white page has none of its own.
 *
 * The well paints --surface rather than inheriting the page. On a white page
 * that is invisible and looks redundant; in the dark theme it is the whole
 * point, because without it each packshot draws its own white rectangle on a
 * near-black ground.
 *
 * Two rules never bend: the aspect ratio is constant, and the image is
 * contained, never covered. A cover crop decapitates a tower UPS and clips the
 * ports off a 24-port switch, which is exactly the silhouette a buyer scans
 * for.
 *
 * THE HOVER IS ONE PLANE MOVING, NOT TWO EFFECTS FIGHTING. Two things happen
 * when a card is pointed at: the alternate angle is wiped across the first, for
 * the 1 354 products that have one, and the picture pushes in by four per cent.
 * They are put on ONE element on purpose. Both frames sit on a single sheet and
 * the sheet is what scales, so the wipe's edge travels across a picture that is
 * already at its new size rather than across a picture that is still growing
 * under it. If the two images scaled separately, the second would arrive at a
 * different magnification from the one it is replacing, and the wipe would read
 * as a glitch instead of as a decision.
 *
 * THE WIPE OWNS THE HOVER, THE ZOOM ONLY LEANS IN. Four per cent, which is a
 * lean and not a zoom: the well is 250px and the packshot is contained inside
 * it with air on at least two sides, so the picture grows into the air it
 * already had and nothing important reaches the border. The magnifier that
 * actually inspects a product lives on the product page, where there is room
 * for it and where the reader has asked for it.
 *
 * A KEYBOARD GETS THE SAME ANSWER A POINTER GETS. The board behind the well
 * already turns on `:focus-within`, so both halves of the hover answer it too.
 * A reader tabbing through a grid otherwise sees the board move under a
 * photograph that does not, which reads as the card half-responding.
 *
 * The scale is on the `scale` property, never on `transform`. `transform` on
 * this element is already spoken for: `.e-media` is uncovered by a shutter that
 * animates `transform` with `both` fill, so a hover written as
 * `transform: scale()` would be overwritten by the entrance's own final frame
 * and simply never appear.
