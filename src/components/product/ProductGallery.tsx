/**
 * The photographs, at the size the decision is actually made at.
 *
 * WHAT THIS LIBRARY IS. 4 215 supplier packshots, every one shot on white, of
 * wildly uneven crop and resolution. So the well is white too and the image is
 * contained, never covered: a cover crop decapitates a tower UPS and clips the
 * ports off a 24-port switch, which is exactly the silhouette this buyer is
 * scanning for. That rule is the same one the grid follows, and it matters more
 * here, because this is the last picture anyone sees before spending money.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE COMPOSITION IS TAKEN FROM E-SHOP, AND IT IS THREE DIFFERENT OBJECTS
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * E-shop's gallery is a sticky index of plates beside the plates themselves on
 * a wide screen, and a swipe rail with a position readout on a phone. Both of
 * those are taken. The middle state is this catalogue's own, because this
 * catalogue's frame is square where E-shop's is 4:5, and a square frame in a
 * narrow column cannot afford to give 88 pixels of its width away.
 *
 *   BELOW md   a snap rail. One packshot fills the shell, the next is swiped
 *              to, and six hairlines say how many there are.
 *   md TO xl   one frame with the thumbnails on a single line beneath it.
 *   xl AND UP  one frame with the thumbnails standing in a column to its left,
 *              which is E-shop's arrangement and the one that reads as a
 *              gallery rather than as a form control under a picture.
 *
 * THE PLATE IS CAPPED AT 480 BETWEEN md AND lg, AND THAT WAS THE WORST NUMBER ON
 * THE PAGE. From 768 to 1023 the page is still ONE column — the spread only
 * splits at lg — so this frame was taking the whole shell and staying square.
 * Measured on the Ideapad before this cap: 653 square at 768, and 765 square at
 * 900. The supplier files behind it are 425 to 576 pixels a side, so at 900 the
 * packshot was being enlarged 1.42 times to fill a white box that then pushed
 * the product's own NAME to y 1186 and the basket button to y 1437, on a screen
 * 900 tall. That is the same failure the phone was rewritten to remove — a
 * screenful of white before the name — reproduced at tablet width, where nobody
 * had looked. 30rem is 480, which sits INSIDE the 425 to 576 band the files
 * actually are, so nothing is enlarged before the reader points at it. The cap
 * is dropped again at lg, where the two-column grid is what limits the frame:
 * 390 at 1024, 624 at 1440. It sits on the component's root so the thumbnail
 * line under the plate is cut to the same 480 and stays a caption on it rather
 * than a rule running past its edge.
 *
 * THE DOM IS THE SAME IN ALL THREE. Every packshot is rendered once; only the
 * flow direction, the order and the visibility change. There is no second
 * component to keep in step and no markup written twice.
 *
 * WHY THE PHONE STOPPED BEING A STACK, MEASURED. At 390 on a 844-pixel screen,
 * the six thumbnails of the Ideapad 3 wrapped onto two rows and drew 332 by 156
 * at y 556. The product's own NAME therefore started at 774, the price at 944
 * and the button at 1090, which is 246 pixels below the fold: the reader met a
 * grid of six near-identical grey laptops before meeting the laptop's name. The
 * rail replaces those 156 pixels with a 13-pixel row of marks. Nothing is lost
 * on the 2 880 references that carry a single photograph, where neither the
 * thumbnails nor the marks are drawn at all.
 *
 * THE INDEX IS ONLY VERTICAL FROM xl, AND THAT IS A MEASUREMENT, NOT A TASTE.
 * The frame is 712 square at 1440 and 576 at 1280, against supplier files that
 * are 425 to 576 pixels a side: at 1440 the packshot is already being enlarged
 * 1.32 times before anyone points at it. Standing the index on the left costs
 * 88 pixels of frame, which takes 1440 to 624 (1.16 times, so slightly sharper)
 * and 1280 to 488 (0.90 times, which is native). Both are good trades. At 1024
 * the same 88 pixels would take a 390-pixel frame to 302, which is 0.56 of the
 * source and the picture would be smaller than the file behind it. So below xl
 * the thumbnails stay under the frame, on one line rather than wrapped.
 *
 * THE SWITCH IS A SHUTTER, NOT A FADE. A crossfade between two packshots on
 * white reads as an image failing to load. The wipe is the same `e-media-shutter`
 * the whole site opens its pictures with, replayed by remounting on the key, so
 * changing angle uses the page's existing vocabulary rather than a second one
 * invented for this component. `motion-safe` carries the reduced-motion guard,
 * so no hook and no client-side media query is needed for it.
 *
 * THE KEY THAT REPLAYS IT IS SWITCHED OFF ON THE RAIL. On a wide screen the
 * chosen packshot's key carries the active index, so choosing it remounts it and
 * the shutter runs; the one leaving is remounted too, behind `display: none`,
 * where nothing is visible. On the rail every packshot is on screen at once and
 * `active` changes with the scroll, so keying on it would remount and re-wipe
 * pictures the reader is in the middle of swiping past. The rail uses the plain
 * url and the pictures hold still.
 *
 * THE THUMBNAILS ONLY EXIST WHEN THERE IS SOMETHING TO CHOOSE. Most products in
 * this export have one photograph; 1 354 have a second. A single thumbnail under
 * a picture is a control that cannot do anything, and drawing one on three
 * quarters of the catalogue would teach readers to ignore the row on the quarter
 * where it works.
 *
 * THE MAGNIFIER IS A READING TOOL, AND ON THIS CATALOGUE IT IS NOT DECORATION.
 * A large part of this stock is a black box whose whole identity is printed
 * small on its own face: the port count along a switch, the legend beside the
 * indicators, the model reference silkscreened on a rack fascia. The packshot
 * carries that detail at a resolution the frame throws away. Pointing at the
 * picture magnifies it 2.3 times around the pointer, so the frame becomes a
 * window that is moved over the photograph rather than a fixed crop of it.
 *
 * WHAT THE MAGNIFIER CAN DO AND WHAT IT CANNOT, MEASURED. The supplier files
 * behind this frame are 425 to 576 pixels square: the eight products sampled
 * off the first page of the catalogue return 540, 540, 425, 540, 540, 540, 540
 * and 576. The frame draws 624 CSS pixels at 1440 once the index is standing
 * beside it, so the photograph is already being enlarged before anyone points at
 * it, and 2.3 times is enlarging an enlargement. This magnifier therefore makes
 * small print BIGGER; it cannot make it SHARPER, because there is no sharper
 * anywhere on the origin. 2.3 is where a control panel legend and a model number
 * crossed from illegible to legible in the frame, and the softness that comes
 * with it is the supplier's file, honestly shown. Nothing here is fixed on this
 * side of the wire: the day the library is re-shot at 1500px, this same number
 * starts resolving detail rather than only enlarging it.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE GOES THROUGH REACT STATE, AND THAT IS A RULE, NOT AN
 * OPTIMISATION. A pointermove is a continuous stream; routing it through
 * `useState` re-renders this component, its images and its thumbnail row on
 * every frame of every mouse movement, to change one number the compositor
 * could have changed alone. The handler writes two custom properties straight
 * onto the frame it is over and the browser does the rest. React re-renders here
 * only when the reader actually chooses another view, which is the only thing
 * that is really state.
 *
 * THE HANDLER READS `currentTarget` RATHER THAN A REF, because there is no
 * longer one frame to hold a ref to. Every packshot is its own frame now, and
 * the frame the pointer is inside is the one the event already names.
 *
 * WHY THE GUARD IS A MEDIA QUERY AND NOT A DEVICE GUESS. The effect exists
 * behind `(hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)`, in CSS and again in the handler.
 * On a touch screen there is no pointer to follow, and a picture that magnifies
 * under the finger holding it is a picture that has swallowed the page's
 * scrolling. On a phone these frames stay frames. That is the honest answer:
 * the alternative is a pinch-zoom viewer nobody asked for, and the browser
 * already has one.
 *
 * AND THE BROWSER'S ONE IS NOT A CONSOLATION HERE, IT IS THE BETTER TOOL,
 * MEASURED. `layout.tsx` declares no `viewport` export, so Next emits
 * `width=device-width, initial-scale=1` with no `maximum-scale` and no
 * `user-scalable=no`: pinch is live on this page. The frame draws 332 CSS
 * pixels at 390 on a screen whose device pixel ratio is 2 or 3, so the
 * photograph is already being painted at 664 to 996 device pixels from a source
 * file that is 425 to 576 across. The reader is looking at an enlargement
 * before touching anything, and there is no detail left on the origin for a
 * second, in-page magnifier to find. A pinch reaches the same ceiling, with the
 * gesture the phone already taught them. That is the answer to "how do I see
 * the small print" on a touch screen, and it costs no code.
 *
 * THE RAIL IS REACHABLE WITHOUT A FINGER. Below md the strip is a scrolling
 * region, and a scrolling region that is not a tab stop is a set of photographs
 * a keyboard cannot reach. It takes `tabIndex` and a `region` role only while it
 * is actually scrolling; from md up it stops scrolling, the attributes are
 * dropped and no dead tab stop is left behind. That answer needs to know the
 * width, and the one hook allowed to know it is `useSyncExternalStore`: a
 * `matchMedia` list is already an external store with a subscribe and a
 * synchronous read, so no effect writes state here and none is needed.
 *
 * The pointer never becomes a way to operate this component: the thumbnails are
 * the control, they are buttons, they are what a keyboard and a screen reader
 * use, and none of them is touched by any of the above.
