/**
 * A product on one line: picture at the left, name and price at the right.
 *
 * The card grid is the right shape when a customer is comparing objects and the
 * photograph is the thing being compared. It is the wrong shape for a column of
 * recent arrivals, where the question is "anything new here" and forty percent
 * of the height of a card is spent on a packshot the reader is only glancing at.
 *
 * So the same product gets a second, quieter form. The picture drops to a
 * 76-pixel square, the specs go, and three of these occupy the height of one
 * card, which is what lets three families of arrivals sit side by side instead
 * of one.
