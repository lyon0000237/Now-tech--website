/**
 * The one place on the site where the basket is a real button.
 *
 * IN THE GRID IT IS A WORD. Ten filled accent rectangles in a grid turn a page of
 * products into a page of buttons, so `AddToCart` there is a quiet control that
 * appears on hover. Here there is exactly one product and exactly one decision,
 * and the control that carries it should look like the most important thing on
 * the column. Same store, same action, different weight, because the context is
 * different: that is the rule, not an inconsistency.
 *
 * THE QUANTITY IS PART OF THE DECISION, NOT AN AFTERTHOUGHT IN THE DRAWER. This
 * shop sells switches, cables, cartridges and mounts: quantities above one are
 * the normal case, not the exception, and asking for eight of something in the
 * drawer means adding one, opening a panel, then correcting a number.
 *
 * OUT OF STOCK IS NOT A DISABLED BUTTON. 338 of 4 254 references are on order,
 * and a greyed-out control tells a customer the shop cannot help them, which is
 * false: the counter genuinely sources these. So the same corner becomes a
 * WhatsApp line, which is how a Cameroonian buyer actually asks whether a
 * reference is really available and receives the proforma.
 *
 * THE CONTROL COMES FIRST AND THE EXPLANATION AFTER IT, WHICH IS E-SHOP'S ORDER
 * AND WAS NOT OURS. The three-line paragraph about ordering the reference used
 * to sit above the WhatsApp button and pushed it 72 pixels down the column; at
 * 390 that put the only action on the page at y 982 on an 844-pixel screen.
 * E-shop prints its waitlist control first and its "this piece is between
 * production runs" underneath, and it is right: the reader has already been told
 * "Sur commande" on the price line four rules above, so the paragraph is not
 * introducing the situation, it is answering the question the button raises.
 * Below the button it answers it in the same place and costs the button nothing.
 *
 * WHAT WAS NOT TAKEN FROM E-SHOP: ITS CONFIRMATION ON THE CONTROL ITSELF. There
 * the label cross-fades to "In your bag" behind a check for 2.2 seconds, with
 * both states stacked in one box so nothing resizes — which is the clean answer
 * to the objection recorded below, and it was measured before being refused.
 * `add()` on both sites opens the basket drawer, and this drawer is 416 pixels
 * of opaque panel pinned right with a full-screen scrim and a 2px blur behind
 * it. At 1440 this button draws x 1058 to 1332, so every pixel of it is under
 * the panel or under the scrim the instant the state it would announce becomes
 * true. E-shop has the same drawer and the same overlap, so what is being copied
 * there is an animation nobody can see. The live region below is the real
 * confirmation for a reader who cannot see the drawer arrive, and the drawer is
 * the confirmation for everyone else.
 *
 * The confirmation is spoken where the click happened. The drawer opens on the
 * other side of a wide monitor, and a panel appearing 1 400 pixels away is not
 * feedback for the hand that just moved.
 *
 * BELOW `sm` THE TWO CONTROLS ARE TWO ROWS, BECAUSE ONE ROW DOES NOT FIT. The
 * buy column is 306px wide at 360. The stepper is 130 and the gap is 12, which
 * leaves 164 for the button, of which 56 is its own padding and 29 is the
 * basket: `Ajouter au panier` had 79px of line to sit on and broke in two, so
 * the button measured 66 tall against 50 at 1440 and the sentence that carries
 * the whole decision was set in two ragged lines. Given its own line it is 306
 * wide, the label sits on one line, and it lands 48px tall at the bottom of the
 * block, which is where a thumb holding the phone one-handed actually reaches.
 *
 * The stepper takes the full width on the same principle, and it is a real
 * improvement rather than a consequence: minus at the far left, plus at the far
 * right, 176px apart instead of 50, on the control most likely to be pressed
 * repeatedly and least likely to be looked at while it is.
 *
 * At 1440 both come back to exactly what they were: stepper 130 by 50 with the
 * count 32 wide, button 274 by 50.
