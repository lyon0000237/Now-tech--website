/**
 * Four lists behind four tabs.
 *
 * The tabs are filters a buyer would actually apply, and each one names the rule
 * it follows in a line under the grid. That line is the whole point of the
 * component: a storefront that labels a shelf "populaire" or "tendance" is
 * asking to be believed, and this catalog carries no order history to be
 * believed with. Naming the rule turns a merchandising claim into a statement a
 * customer can check against the prices in front of them.
 *
 * All four lists are rendered on the server and shipped together, so switching
 * tabs is instant and works the same on a stalled connection as on a fast one.
 * Only the active one is in the DOM: forty cards mounted at once would cost more
 * than the switch saves.
 *
 * KEYBOARD. A `tablist` promises arrow-key navigation, and a tablist that does
 * not deliver it is worse than four ordinary buttons: it tells a screen-reader
 * user to press a key that does nothing. So the roving tabindex below is not a
 * refinement, it is the price of using the role at all. One stop enters the set,
 * arrows move within it, Home and End jump to the ends.
