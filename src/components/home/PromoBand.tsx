/**
 * The banner band under the deck, two at a time.
 *
 * WHY IT TRAVELS. Two panels standing still were a pair of shortcuts to the two
 * departments a customer already knew they wanted. Six that walk are the shop
 * saying it has six counters, in the space the two took.
 *
 * WHY PAGES OF TWO AND NOT A FREE SCROLL. A strip that slides by one panel makes
 * the reader track a moving target, and it always leaves a half-panel at the
 * edge, which reads as a layout that ran out of room. Whole pages arrive
 * composed: two banners land together, sit still long enough to be read, and
 * leave together.
 *
 * WHY IT OVERSHOOTS. This is the one bounce on the site, and it is three per
 * cent. Everything else decelerates and stops exactly, which is right for a rack
 * rail and wrong for a poster: a banner that lands dead reads as a slide, one
 * that lands with a little weight reads as a thing that was thrown.
 *
 * WHY IT WALKS BACK. Three pages that loop have to rewind two widths at the end.
 * It goes 1, 2, 3, 2, 1 instead, so every move is one page in one direction and
 * no frame is spent rewinding.
 *
 * ON A PHONE THE BAND TAKES A FINGER, AND THE ARITHMETIC IS WHY. A page is two
 * panels side by side on a desktop and two panels STACKED on a phone: measured
 * at 360, 394.5 + 415.3 plus the gap makes the band 830 pixels tall. The three
 * bars are underneath all of it, so the only way to reach the last four
 * departments was to scroll 830 pixels past the thing being controlled, tap,
 * and then scroll back up to find that the panels above had changed. A control
 * that far from its subject is not a control. The panels themselves now answer
 * a swipe, exactly as the banners above them do and with the same numbers: 44
 * pixels of horizontal travel is a page, `touch-action: pan-y` leaves the page
 * scrolling underneath, and the drag suppresses the click so a swipe never
 * lands on a department. The bars stay, as the readout they always were.

 * halts while a pointer rests on it, which is the reader's brake — and a
 * touchscreen has no pointer to rest. On a phone the two banners stand 830
 * pixels tall, so a reader who is halfway down the second one when the clock
 * fires at 5 600ms has the page replaced under their thumb with no way to stop
 * it and no way to get it back. Standing still, the pages below are the control.
