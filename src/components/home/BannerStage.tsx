/**
 * The opening: the designer's banners, edge to edge, and nothing else.
 *
 * WHY THE SECTION IS EMPTY APART FROM THE PICTURE. Each of these is a finished
 * piece with its own headline, its own line of copy, its own call to action and
 * the shop's mark already in the pixels. Anything the site adds around them is
 * the same sentence twice in two voices. So there is no heading, no rail, no
 * gutter and no margin: the artwork starts at the left edge of the screen and
 * ends at the right one, and the page begins underneath it.
 *
 * THE WIDE PIECE IS SHOWN AT 4.73:1 AND THERE IS NO OTHER OPTION. At full width
 * that is 305 pixels on a 1440 screen and 406 on a 1920, which is a strip rather
 * than an opening, and a taller box does not fix it: `cover` on a source wider
 * than its frame crops the SIDES, so a 3:1 window ate a quarter of the width and
 * cut "plus de plaisir en cuisine" in half. Height cannot be taken out of a
 * 14179 x 3000 file; it was never in it.
 *
 * The two ways out are the designer's, not the code's: a 3:1 or 21:9 cut of each
 * banner, or a taller hero built from the 1:1 pieces. Until one arrives, the
 * artwork is shown whole, because a cropped headline is worse than a short one.
 *
 * THE MOTION IS NVC'S STUDIO CAROUSEL. Same machine, to the number: a track
 * translated by `index * (100 / length)` on a spring at stiffness 300, damping
 * 30, autoplay every 5 000ms, and an IntersectionObserver that stops the cycle
 * while the section is off screen. A spring rather than an eased curve is the
 * character of it: the strip arrives with weight and settles, which is what
 * makes a poster read as a panel sliding into place rather than as an image
 * being swapped.
 *
 * THE PHONE WINDOW IS 21:9, AND THE ARITHMETIC PICKED IT, NOT TASTE. It was
 * 16:9, which shows 1.78 / 4.726 = 37.6% of the artwork's width. Measured on the
 * five pieces, the headline alone spans between 26% and 43% of that width, so a
 * 37.6% window cut every one of them: "plus de plaisir en cuisin", "Protégez
 * votre ré", "Imprimez Sans Lim". A 21:9 window shows 49.4%, which clears the
 * widest headline (banner 6, 42.7%) with room on both sides, and it is the last
 * window that does: 2:1 shows 42.3% and clips that same piece by 1.9%.
 *
 * AND THE CROP WAS CENTRED ON THE WRONG POINT. `focus` is documented as where
 * the words sit ACROSS THE ARTWORK, but it was handed straight to
 * `object-position`, which under `cover` measures a fraction of the OVERFLOW,
 * not of the image. On the cuisine piece, focus 70 put the window's centre at
 * 62.5% instead of 70% and shaved the last word off the headline. The
 * conversion below is the whole fix: X = (focus - k/2) / (1 - k), where k is the
 * share of the artwork's width the window shows.
 *
 * THE PHONE HAS NO ARROWS AND NEVER HAD A SWIPE, WHICH LEFT IT NO CONTROL AT
 * ALL. THE ARROWS AND THE DOTS ARE THE SAME TWO CONTROLS AT EVERY WIDTH NOW.
 * They were not: the arrows were hidden below sm on the argument that a disc
 * punched into a 130px band is a hole in the artwork, and the dots were inflated
 * to 44px squares to be tappable. The result was a phone carrying a different
 * carousel from the one the shop had designed, with no manual control except
 * five large targets that did not look like a position readout any more. The
 * arrows are 32px on a phone, 40 from sm and 48 from md, and the dots keep six
 * pixels
 * everywhere with a 42px hit area drawn by a pseudo-element, which is how every
 * other small control on this site is made tappable without being made bigger.
 * The old reasoning, kept because it is still the reason the discs are
 * translucent rather than solid: a 48px disc punched into a
 * 154px picture is a hole. But that left five 6px indicators whose hit areas
 * overlapped each other by 24 pixels as the only way to steer, on the one device
 * that cannot hover. So the track now takes a finger: a horizontal drag past 44
 * pixels moves one banner, `touch-action: pan-y` keeps the page scrolling
 * vertically underneath it, and the drag suppresses the click so a swipe never
 * lands on the department page. The indicators become 44px cells on the phone
 * and keep their 6px mark.
 *
 * THE MOUSE DRAGS TOO NOW, AND IT USED TO BE TURNED AWAY AT THE DOOR. The
 * handler opened with `if (event.pointerType === 'mouse') return`, on the
 * reasoning that the desktop already had two arrows and that a click on the
 * artwork has to stay a click. The first half was true and the second half was
 * already solved: the click suppression below is not a touch feature, it reads
 * the same `swiped` flag whatever moved. So the strip takes a cursor exactly as
 * it takes a thumb, which is what anyone who has used a carousel since 2010
 * tries first, and the pointer is captured on the way down so a drag that
 * carries off the edge of the section still lands rather than freezing the strip
 * mid-slide.
 *
 * ONE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO, AND IT IS NOT COSMETIC. The axis guard, which
 * hands a gesture steeper than it is wide back to the page, exists because a
 * finger has one movement for two jobs: swiping the strip and scrolling the
 * document. A mouse does not scroll by dragging, so a slightly diagonal pull
 * from a cursor is a swipe with a shaky hand, and cancelling it is the software
 * arguing with the reader. The guard is now a touch's alone.
 *
 * AND THE TOUR HOLDS STILL WHILE ANYONE IS HOLDING THE STRIP. It did not: only
 * a mouse hovering paused the autoplay, so a finger part-way through a swipe
 * could have the panel changed underneath it by the five-second tick, and a
 * cursor dragged past the section's edge fired `pointerleave` and restarted the
 * clock mid-gesture. A hand on the artwork is now its own brake, separate from
 * the hover brake and unaffected by it.
 *
 * AND THE PAUSE IS A MOUSE'S, WHICH IS WHY IT USED TO KILL THE PHONE'S TOUR.
 * `pointerenter` fires for a finger as well as for a cursor, and `pointerleave`
 * does not follow it: a thumb set down on the artwork to scroll the page raised
 * `held` and nothing ever lowered it again. Measured on a 360 screen: the strip
 * sat on banner 1 for eleven seconds after one touch, where two ticks should
 * have taken it to banner 3. A touchscreen has a swipe and needs no brake, so
 * the brake is now a mouse's alone.

/**
 * THE DESIGNER'S CUT ARRIVED, AND IT RETIRED THIRTY LINES OF ARITHMETIC.
 *
 * What stood here was a conversion from a banner's declared `focus` to an
 * `object-position`, plus the three constants it needed: the artwork's own
 * 4.726:1, the 21:9 window a phone was shown it through, and the 0.4937 share of
 * the width that window revealed. It existed for one reason, which the comment at
 * the head of this file stated as a limitation rather than as a design: a
 * 14 179 by 3 000 piece cannot be shown whole on a phone, so something had to
 * choose which half survived, and no choice was good because the headlines span
 * up to 43 per cent of a width the window only showed 49 per cent of.
 *
 * That comment also named the two ways out and said both belonged to the designer
 * and not to the code. One of them has now been taken: each piece has been
 * recomposed at 3.046:1, so the phone is shown a complete picture and nothing is
 * cropped at all. The arithmetic that chose a crop has nothing left to choose,
 * and code kept "in case" is code nobody dares to change. `focus` stays in the
 * constant, unread, as the honest record of where the words sit on the wide
 * piece, and because a sixth banner arriving without a mobile cut would need it
 * back.

                      `getImageProps` is Next's own answer to art direction, and it
                      is the right tool here for a reason two stacked `Image`s
                      would have got wrong: with `hidden sm:block` both files are
                      in the document, and the one carrying `priority` is fetched
                      whether it will be shown or not. A phone on a metered
                      connection would have paid for a 14 179-pixel-wide desktop
                      banner it never displays. A `<source media>` is decided
                      before a single byte moves.

                      The query is 640px because that is Tailwind's `sm`, and `sm`
                      is where the box changes ratio two lines above. The two have
                      to be the same number, or for one breakpoint's width the
                      frame and the file disagree and the piece is either cropped
                      or letterboxed. */}

      {/* On the picture, at its foot, centred. Circles rather than bars because
          they sit on artwork: a bar reads as a rule, and this page draws rules
          to mean structure. Six pixels: they are a position readout, not a
          control anyone hunts for, and the arrows beside them are the control.

          A HIT AREA WIDER THAN THE SPACE BETWEEN TWO DOTS IS NOT A HIT AREA,
          IT IS A LOTTERY, AND THIS ROW HELD ONE ON EVERY SCREEN. The dots were
          6px marks 8px apart, a pitch of 14, each carrying a square
          pseudo-element inflated by `-inset-4` to 38px across. Each target
          therefore covered its neighbours, later siblings paint over earlier
          ones, and the row resolved to whichever dot came last. Measured with
          `elementFromPoint` at each dot's OWN centre, at 1440 and at 390 alike:
          Cuisine hit Réseaux, Réseaux hit TV et audio, TV et audio hit
          Électroménager, Électroménager hit Impression. Four of the five
          indicators could not be pressed at all, and pressing the one labelled
          TV et audio brought up Électroménager.

          The fix is arithmetic, not judgement. The gap is 20px, so the pitch is
          26; the target is inflated by 8px a side, so it is 22 across and clears
          its neighbour by 4. It keeps the full 38px of height, which costs
          nothing because there is nothing above or below it. Same mark, same
          size, same behaviour at every width, and each one now answers for
          itself. */}
