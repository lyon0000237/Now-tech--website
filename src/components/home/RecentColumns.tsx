 * The newest arrivals, three families side by side.
 *
 * The export has no creation date, so recency is taken from the WooCommerce id,
 * which agrees with the upload month stamped on the product's own photograph
 * 98.4% of the time. Nothing here is hand-picked: the families shown are the
 * ones whose newest product is genuinely the newest, capped at one family per
 * department so the whole section does not fill with networking simply because
 * that is where the new stock lands.
 *
 * Columns of lines rather than a grid of cards, and that is the section's whole
 * argument. Twelve cards would be twelve photographs of black boxes and one
 * question answered; twelve lines in three labelled columns answer a different
 * and better one, which is where in the shop things are moving this month.
