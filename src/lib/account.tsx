/**
 * The customer file.
 *
 * THERE IS NO SERVER BEHIND THIS, AND SAYING SO IS PART OF THE FEATURE. This
 * storefront has no API route that writes, no database, no session cookie and no
 * identity provider, and none is planned in this lot. What follows is therefore
 * not an account system and never pretends to be one.
 *
 * WHAT THE SESSION IS. One JSON object in this browser's `localStorage`, under
 * `nowtech.fiche.v1`, read through `useSyncExternalStore` exactly the way the
 * basket next door is read. It lives on one device, in one browser profile. It
 * does not follow the customer to their phone, it does not survive clearing site
 * data, and two people sharing a machine share the file.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It does not authenticate anybody, and it could not: the
 * whole store is readable and writable from the developer console in four
 * seconds. "Signing in" here means filling in a card and keeping it; "signing
 * out" means deleting the card. Nothing in the interface may suggest otherwise,
 * which is why there is no lock, no "forgot your password", and no claim of a
 * secure connection anywhere on the dialog.
 *
 * WHICH IS WHY THERE IS NO PASSWORD FIELD, and that is a security decision
 * rather than a shortcut. A password typed into a form with nothing behind it
 * can only end up in `localStorage`, in plain text, on a shared machine — and
 * the password a customer types into a shop is very often the one they reuse
 * elsewhere. Asking for a secret we cannot protect, cannot verify and do not
 * need is strictly worse than not asking. So the field does not exist, hashed or
 * otherwise: a hash in `localStorage` next to the account it unlocks protects
 * nothing and only makes the pretence look sturdier.
 *
 * WHAT THE FILE IS ACTUALLY FOR, honestly, on this site. Nothing is paid online:
 * the shop is settled in cash at the counter, on delivery, or by Mobile Money
 * against a proforma. So there is no order history to guard and no wallet to
 * protect. What a customer genuinely gains by being known between visits is that
 * the three facts a proforma needs stop being retyped: the name that goes on the
 * document, the WhatsApp number the proforma is sent to, and the counter they
 * collect from. Those three, and the material list that already exists as
 * `lib/cart.tsx`, are the entire contents of an account here.
 */

/**
 * AND THERE IS NO E-MAIL ON THIS CARD, WHICH IS THE SAME DECISION AS THE
 * PASSWORD, TAKEN TWICE. The card used to carry an optional address, collected
 * under the promise "Pour recevoir la proforma en PDF". Nothing in this codebase
 * ever read that field, no route renders a PDF, and no message is sent from
 * anywhere: the proforma is asked for and delivered over WhatsApp, on the number
 * two lines above. A field that collects a real address against a service that
 * does not exist is a promise with a text cursor in it, so it is removed rather
 * than relabelled. {@link parse} drops a stored address on the next read, so the
 * cards written by the previous version shed theirs the first time they are
 * opened, and nothing is left in storage that we cannot account for. If a later
 * lot ever mails a document, the field comes back with the sending.
