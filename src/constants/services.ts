/**
 * The workshop's trades, and the rule that files its own records under them.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `/services` used to print one flat price list read
 * straight off a WooCommerce term, and a reader who arrived asking "what do you
 * know how to do" was handed nineteen rows sorted by price. Nineteen rows is a
 * catalogue. Five trades is an answer. Nothing here adds a prestation, a rate
 * or a lead time: a trade is a HEADING OVER RECORDS THAT ALREADY EXIST, and if
 * no record matches, the heading is not drawn.
 *
 * THE ORDER OF THE FIRST FOUR IS NOT A PREFERENCE. `constants/assistant.ts`
 * already answers the installation question with one sentence, "vidéosurveillance,
 * réseau, contrôle d'accès, onduleurs et solaire", and that sentence is the only
 * public claim this shop makes about its own workshop. The four headings below
 * are that sentence, split. The fifth exists because the supplier filed
 * accounting, customs, joinery, graphic design and car mechanics under the same
 * term, and hiding them would be editing the shop rather than describing it.
 *
 * MATCHED ON A FOLDED NAME, NEVER ON A HAND-PICKED LIST OF IDS. The export
 * spells the same word three ways inside nineteen rows: `Controle d'accès` with
 * no circumflex, `Energie solaire` and `d'energie solaire` with no acute,
 * `INSTALLATION ELECTRIQUE` in capitals beside `installation du kit`. An id list
 * would be right today and silently wrong at the next rebuild; a fold to
 * lowercase unaccented text is right in both.

/**
 * THE ONE PICTURE A TRADE IS ALLOWED TO CARRY, AND THE ONLY DOWNLOADED
 * PHOTOGRAPHS ON THIS ENTIRE STOREFRONT.
 *
 * THE RULE EVERYWHERE ELSE IS THAT WE ILLUSTRATE WITH WHAT THE SHOP OWNS. The
 * catalogue holds 4 215 packshots, so a family, a rayon and a brand each get to
 * show a real product they actually sell, which is free, unambiguous and true.
 * `/services` is the one page that cannot do that, and the reason is structural
 * rather than editorial: THE WORKSHOP DOES NOT SELL A PHOTOGRAPHABLE OBJECT. A
 * technician's morning on a ladder has no packshot, and the fourteen pieces of
 * hardware that share the supplier's term are exactly the confusion this page
 * was rewritten to remove. Printing a laptop next to "installation de caméras"
 * would put the mistake straight back.
 *
 * SO FIVE PICTURES WERE DOWNLOADED, ONCE, AND THEY LIVE ON OUR ORIGIN. Free
 * licence, checkable in one click from `source`, served from `/metiers/` and
 * never hot-linked to anybody's CDN: a storefront whose audience pays for its
 * megabytes does not put five third-party requests on a page it controls.
 *
 * WHAT THEY MAY AND MAY NOT SHOW, and this is the part that matters more than
 * the licence. Not one of them may be read as a photograph of NowTech. No
 * identifiable person appears in any of the five, no shopfront, no signage, no
 * branded van, nothing that a reader could take for the counters in Akwa or for
 * the people behind them. They are pictures of the TRADE, not of the firm, and
 * because a picture cannot say that about itself the page says it in words
 * underneath, in `PHOTO_NOTE`. A page whose whole argument is that it invents
 * nothing cannot open with an image that implies something.
 *
 * The subjects are the trades themselves, read off the records that group under
 * each heading: a camera on a wall, a patch panel, a roof of solar modules, an
 * opened laptop on a bench, a joiner's tool wall. Nothing is generated, nothing
 * is an office stock scene, and nothing is a picture of a happy customer.
