/**
 * Downloads the manufacturer logomarks the brand wall renders.
 *
 *   node scripts/fetch-brand-marks.mjs
 *
 * WHY THE FILES ARE COMMITTED. They are fetched once, written to
 * `public/brands/`, and served from our own origin. A CDN `<img>` per logo would
 * put fourteen third-party requests on the critical path of a page whose
 * audience is on a metered connection, and would break the day the CDN does.
 * Nothing at runtime talks to simpleicons.org.
 *
 * WHAT IS DOWNLOADED. Simple Icons ships the marks themselves under CC0. The
 * trademarks remain their owners'; a distributor naming and showing the brands
 * it stocks is nominative use, which is what this wall is. Each file is a single
 * path with no colour, which is why the component can paint it as a mask.
 *
 * WHICH BRANDS. Only those the catalog actually carries AND that have a mark.
 * The wall is ranked by the same depth the rest of the site ranks brands by, so
 * a brand with no mark is skipped rather than drawn as a word beside a logo:
 * half a wall of type and half a wall of marks reads as a wall that failed to
 * load. Hikvision, Dahua, ZKTeco, Grandstream, Canon and D-Link have no mark in
 * the set and are reachable from `/marques` instead.
